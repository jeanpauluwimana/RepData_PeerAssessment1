Time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis):

```{r}
avg.steps <- aggregate(clean.data$steps, by = list(clean.data$interval), FUN = mean)
names(avg.steps) <- c("interval", "steps") # renaming columns to interval & steps, respectively
png(filename = "avgsteps.png", height = 680, width = 680)

dev.off()
```

The 5-minute interval that contains the maximum number of steps on average across all days:
```{r}
max.steps <- avg.steps[which.max(avg.steps$x), ]
max.steps
```

Total number of missing values
```{r}
missing.values <- activity.data[grepl("NA", activity.data), ]
```

Attempting imputation...
```{r}
#Dataset with missing dataset filled-in
activity.data[is.na(activity.data)] <- avg.steps$steps 
```

Total number of steps taken per day with missing data filled in
```{r}
steps.with.imput <- aggregate(activity.data$steps, by = list(activity.data$date), FUN = sum, na.rm = T)
names(steps.with.imput) <- c("date", "steps")
steps.with.imput # Printing total number of steps with missing data filled in

hist(steps.with.imput$steps, main = "Number of steps per day with missing data filled in", xlab = "Steps per day", col = "red")
dev.off()
```

Mean of total number of steps taken per day with missing data filled in
```{r}
mean.with.imput <- aggregate(activity.data$steps, by = list(activity.data$date), FUN = mean)
mean.with.imput
```

Median of total number of steps taken per day with missing data filled in 
```{r}
median.with.imput <- aggregate(activity.data$steps, by = list(activity.data$date), FUN = median)
median.with.imput
```

Differences in activity between weekdays and weekends
```{r}
# Subsetting for weekdays
weekdays <- activity.data[weekdays(as.Date(activity.data$date)) %in% c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"), ]
weekdays$date <- "weekday" 

# Subsetting for weekends
weekends <- activity.data[weekdays(as.Date(activity.data$date)) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), ]

# Merging data weekends and weekdays
activity.data <- rbind(weekends, weekdays)
  
# Susbetting by type of day
